# ultimate-batch-anime-downloader
## [Deprecated]


This project should barely work but you should not expect more work to be done to improve or to fix any bugs if it breaks.

I would advice you to use :
1. [Kickassanime downloader](https://github.com/KorigamiK/kickassanime-downloader) Which should provide you with more and better features than this one. I work on it from time to time.
2. [Tenshimoe-dl](https://github.com/KorigamiK/tenshimoe-dl) Which works but has a smaller library.

`Of course you can search for better programs than this one. I'm sorry it was never able to become what I had imagined it to become but it layed the ground work for moy other projects. Maybe I'll come back to it in the future and make it what it was imagined to be.`


The new and improved version of batch anime downloader. Made more efficient from the older version.

## Requirements:
1. python 3.x 
2. paste the following in your command prompt/ terminal (make sure you have pip in your system path ! [search youtube])

```
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests html.parser wget
```
3. Or you can simply (Check that you are on the same directory as requirements.py)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# For downloading
1. Press y when prompted to download or
2. Use any download manager such as [jdownloader2](https://jdownloader.org/download/index) and copy the links from the csv file :)
  and use its built in feature to parse links from clipboard :)

# Usage
0. ### Make sure that you keep all the files in the same folder !
1. It uses [this website](https://yugenani.me) and [this website](https://gogoanime.so/) to scrape
2. A sample url to pass would be https://yugenani.me/anime/boruto-naruto-next-generations/watch/ or https://gogoanime.so/category/black-clover-tv
3. ### Use the run.bat to run the script (for windows).
4. Follow the instruction when you run the script
5. ### Use the 'search and download.py' script to get more options when you search!
6. Run the "update anime_list.py" if you are not able to find any new anime (It takes a lot of time to update) 
7. To use the anime_list.csv method: 
   - Open it using notepad
   - Use Control+F and type the anime name you want
   - Copy the name you find there
   - Use this name when you run downloader.py
   - Bonus: You can try to get lucky by typing the name of the anime directly !
8. ENJOY !
